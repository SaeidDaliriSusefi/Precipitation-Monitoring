# 🌍 Precipitation Trend Monitoring using Google Earth Engine & Python
This repository contains a Python-based workflow to analyze long-term precipitation trends (annual average) over a selected region using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ERA5 Monthly Aggregates datasets(available from 1980 with 27km resolution). The script leverages geospatial libraries and statistical tools to extract, process, and visualize temperature data over time, providing insights into climate change patent.
